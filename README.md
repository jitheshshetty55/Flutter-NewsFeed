# flutter_newsapp

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

News App Project
The application connects to the internet and fetches news from the Feed News
 based on categories set in Firebase firestore api using HttpURLConnection,
 which is then parsed using a custom built JSON parser.
 The parsed information is then presented as a news feed in categories and displayed in stack and scroll card view
 with a share option and filter option in drawer page.
